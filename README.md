#TypeScript Fundamentals

This is a site that wraps around 4 different guides connected in Module 3.

The landing page is just the NextJS starter template that I modified.

The guides are then seperate children pages using components from ShadCN and react-code-blocks.

The assignments for each guide are inside an accordion to centralize them and make it easy to navigate
each assignment without leaving the page or filling the site with content.

Instead of console logging results I used a custom toast from shadcn to emulate a terminal.

Everything is styled with tailwindCSS.

Added framer motion for page transitions.
